          <p>Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes.)</p>
          <p>It is important to grant people the space to speak from the place that they are in and allow others to narrate the world they inhabit without needing to put them in a box of your own making. </p>
          <p>A lot of day to day misunderstandings between people of different groups (age, class, creed, etc.) doesn't stem from a lapse of morals or values but rather flawed communication. Language, diction, and exact connotations have more power than we know. </p>

          <p>"In cultures regulated by political correctness, people feel judged and fear being blamed. They worry about how others view them as representatives of their social identity groups. They feel inhibited and afraid to address even the most banal issues directly." (Harvard Business Review)</p>
          <p>In essence, the problem is that people refuse to say what they truly think and sometimes will blatantly lie to be in favour of others. It's a paradox.</p>
          <p>It's unfortunate but the brain is wired with a deep US vs. THEM mindset which can make breaking from your bubble paralyzingly difficult. It was once a useful survival tool but now it causes us to see things in black and white. In the online space, we think that if we aren't on the offensive, we are being attacked. Silence is always a choice but if it's a topic close to your heart, keeping quiet would be an even greater transgression. </p>
          <p>It's important to distinguish that censorship is a hindrance of free speech specifically and not a quieting of hate speech. Hate in all forms should be done away with. </p>

          <p>Parody is making fun of other forms of media through ridiculous exaggeration, oftentimes to prove a more complex or serious point. Good parodies nail the essence of a subject—its style, tone and voice—to within an inch of being mistaken for the real thing. It's not about finding your voice but rather finding the voice and tone of who you're trying to imitate</p>
          <p>Even in scientific studies, the difference in language greatly affected how a reader interpreted a texts message</p>
          <p>In the olden ages, princes often had an abundance of freedom compared to commoners or other members of society. As heirs to the throne, they were granted privileges and liberties that allowed them to indulge in excesses and extravagances. With fewer restrictions and obligations than their subjects, princes could freely pursue their interests, whether it be in the arts, leisure activities, or personal pursuits. This freedom often led to a sense of entitlement and a lack of accountability, as princes were shielded from the consequences of their actions due to their royal status. Their unchecked behavior and unrestrained lifestyle sometimes resulted in scandalous or reckless behavior, causing unrest or dissatisfaction among the populace. However, this unchecked freedom also allowed princes to explore and develop their talents, leadership skills, and visions, shaping their capabilities as future rulers of the realm.</p>
